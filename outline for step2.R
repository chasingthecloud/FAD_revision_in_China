## step2 analysis ###
#####################

# in step 0 and 1, we marked Chinese & foriegn datasets with the variable "g" and its original datasets with the "NO"
# where "g"==0 & "NO"==1 --> FAD_1
# where "g"==0 & "NO"==2 --> FAD_2
# where "g"==0 & "NO"==3 --> FAD_3
# where "g"==1 & "NO"==4 --> FAD_A
# where "g"==1 & "NO"==5 --> FAD_F
# where "g"==1 & "NO"==6 --> FAD_J


#1. Descriptions of gender, age & education level
#2. Classical Test Theory (CTT) in both datasets (Chinese & foreign)
##### descriptions and frecuencys of each items
##### alpha,item-total correlation, alpha if item deleted
##### correlations: dimensions-dimensions; dimensions-items; items-items
#3. CFA based on 4 dimension model in both datasets and plots
#4. measurement invariance with CFA multigroup and with "measurementInvariance" function directly (the same)
#5. EFA with 4 factors in both datasets
#6. CPA in both datasets
#7. IRT
###### estimation of parameters with graded response model with 4 dimensions
###### estimation of parameters with generalized graded unfolding model by each dimension
###### Lordif one method of DIF (differential item functioning) in IRT
