# FAD_revision in China
This project aims to revise the Free Will and Determinism Plus Scale into Chinese. To validate the adapted instrument in new context, we will evaluate the factorial structure, other evidence of validity, and relaibility. Besides, we will also assess the measurement invariance for cross-cultural studies consideration.
